 * @method string getId()         Unique identifier of the business connection
 * @method User   getUser()       Business account user that created the business connection
 * @method int    getUserChatId() Identifier of a private chat with the user who created the business connection. This number may have more than 32 significant bits and some programming languages may have difficulty/silent defects in interpreting it. But it has at most 52 significant bits, so a 64-bit integer or double-precision float type are safe for storing this identifier.
