/**
 * @method string      getFileId()       Identifier for this file, which can be used to download or reuse the file
 * @method string      getFileUniqueId() Unique identifier for this file, which is supposed to be the same over time and for different bots. Can't be used to download or reuse the file.
 * @method int|null    getFileSize()     Optional. File size in bytes. It can be bigger than 2^31 and some programming languages may have difficulty/silent defects in interpreting it. But it has at most 52 significant bits, so a signed 64-bit integer or double-precision float type are safe for storing this value.
 * @method string|null getFilePath()     Optional. File path. Use https://api.telegram.org/file/bot<token>/<file_path> to get the file.
